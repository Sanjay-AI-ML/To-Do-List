📝 To-Do List Application (Tkinter)
A simple, clean, and fully functional desktop To-Do List application built using Python and Tkinter.
This project focuses on clarity, ease of use, and complete task management — making it a great beginner-friendly yet feature-rich productivity tool.

🚀 Features
✅ Task Management
  •	Add new tasks easily.
  •	Delete selected tasks.
  •	Mark tasks as completed.
  •	Clear all tasks when needed.
🗂️ Two-Tab Layout
  •	Tasks to Complete – view all pending tasks
  •	Completed Tasks – view all tasks you’ve finished
This clear separation helps users track progress visually.
💾 Save & Load Tasks
  •	Save tasks to JSON files with automatic date + numbering
  •	Load any saved session back into the app
  •	Keeps both "pending" and "completed" sections intact
📁 Automatic Save Directory
  Creates a folder (To_Do_Saves/) if it doesn’t exist and stores all save files neatly.

🔧 Technologies Used
•	Python 3.x
•	Tkinter (built-in GUI library)
•	JSON for file storage
•	OS & Datetime modules for file handling and auto-naming

🎯 Purpose of the Project
This project was built to practice:
  •	GUI application development in Python
  •	Event-driven programming
  •	File handling (JSON save/load)
  •	Clean code structuring and function separation
  •	Tkinter layout management (Frames, LabelFrames, Grid System)
It’s a great portfolio-friendly project showcasing both GUI design and functional logic.
